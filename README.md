## Participatory Policy Feedback System
A simplified implementation might involve a citizen feedback loop embedded in a government decision-making platform. Citizens vote or give sentiment on proposed policies, and the system analyzes trends and informs decision-makers dynamically.

## 🔧 System Overview
Citizens submit feedback on a proposed government policy.

The system evaluates sentiment.

An admin dashboard shows real-time sentiment trends.

Policy recommendations adjust based on aggregate citizen input (a basic cybernetic loop).

## 📦 Installation
